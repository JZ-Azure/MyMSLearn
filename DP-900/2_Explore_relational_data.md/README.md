## Understand relational data
In a relational database, you model collections of entities from the real world as _tables_.
- each row in a table has the same columns
- not all columns need to have a value
- each column stores data of a specific datatype

## Understand normalization
Normalization is a term used by database professionals for a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity.
- Separate each entity into its own table.
- Separate each discrete attribute into its own column.
- Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.
- Use foreign key columns to link related entities.

Azure HDInsight is a cloud service that lets you implement, manage, and monitor a cluster for Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Kafka, Storm, Hive LLAP, and ML Service in an easy and effective way. Its applications include batch and stream processing, data science, and interactive query over big data storage. Decoupling compute from storage allows for processing at scale.

Azure Databricks is a cloud service from the creators of Apache Spark, combined with a great integration with the Azure platform. It supports only Spark clusters, but since the Spark framework comes with modules and libraries for batch processing, stream processing, data science, and graph databases, it is rapidly growing in popularity.

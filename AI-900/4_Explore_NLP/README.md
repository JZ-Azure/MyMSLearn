- Applying stemming or lemmatization algorithms to normalize words before counting them.
- Applying linguistic structure rules to analyze sentences.
- Encoding words or terms as numeric features that can be used to train a machine learning model.
- Creating vectorized models that capture semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in n-dimensional space.

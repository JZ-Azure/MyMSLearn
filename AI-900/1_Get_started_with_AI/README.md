## Azure Machine Learning
A cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models
|Feature|Capability|
|---|---|
|Automated machine learning|This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.|
|Azure Machine Learning designer|A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.|
|Data and compute management|Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.|
|Pipelines|Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.|


## Anomaly detection
[Anomaly Detector service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/#overview) provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.

## Computer vision
|Service|Capabilities|
|---|---|
|Computer Vision|You can use this service to analyze images and video, and extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text.|
|Custom Vision|Use this service to train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images.|
|Face|The Face service enables you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.|
|Form Recognizer|Use this service to extract information from scanned forms and invoices.|

## Natural language processing
|Service|Capabilities|
|---|---|
|Language|Use this service to access features for understanding and analyzing text, training language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building intelligent applications.|
|Translator|Use this service to translate text between more than 60 languages.|
|Speech|Use this service to recognize and synthesize speech, and to translate spoken languages.|
|Azure Bot|This service provides a platform for conversational AI, the capability of a software "agent" to participate in a conversation. Developers can use the Bot Framework to create a bot and manage it with Azure Bot Service - integrating back-end services like Language, and connecting to channels for web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, and others.|

## Knowledge mining
- Azure Cognitive Search, a private, enterprise, search solution that has tools for building indexes. 
- The indexes can then be used for internal only use, or to enable searchable content on public facing internet assets.

## Responsible AI
- Fairness
- Reliability and safety
- Privacy and security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability

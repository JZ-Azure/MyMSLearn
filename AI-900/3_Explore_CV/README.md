## Introduction
- Microsoft's Computer Vision service gives you access to _pre-trained_ computer vision capabilities.

## Azure resources for Computer Vision
- **Computer Vision**: A specific resource for the Computer Vision service. Use this resource type if you don't intend to use any other cognitive services, or if you want to track utilization and costs for your Computer Vision resource separately.
- **Cognitive Services**: A general cognitive services resource that includes Computer Vision along with many other cognitive services; such as Text Analytics, Translator Text, and others. Use this resource type if you plan to use multiple cognitive services and want to simplify administration and development.
- **Custom Vision**: Common techniques used to train image classification models have been encapsulated into the Custom Vision cognitive service in Microsoft Azure. You can use the Custom Vision cognitive service to train image classification models and deploy them as services for applications to use.
  - Can be either a training, a prediction or a both resource.
    - Creating a Custom Vision resource for both training and prediction results in **two separate resources** being provisioned, each with their own key and endpoint.
    - A **single cognitive service resource** can be used for both training and prediction.
  - Enables you to create object detection models

### Image analysis types
- Image description
- Tagging visual features
- Detecting objects
- Detecting brands
- Detecting faces
- Categorizing an image
- Detecting domain-specific content
- Optical character recognition

### Object detection
An object detection model returns the following information:
- The **class** of each object identified in the image.
- The **probability score** of the object classification.
- The **coordinates of a bounding box** for each object.

## Model training and evaluation
- **Precision**: What percentage of class predictions did the model correctly identify? For example, if the model predicted that 10 images are oranges, of which eight were actually oranges, then the precision is 0.8 (80%).
- **Recall**: What percentage of the class predictions made by the model were correct? For example, if there are 10 images of apples, and the model found 7 of them, then the recall is 0.7 (70%).
- **Mean Average Precision** (mAP): An overall metric that takes into account both precision and recall across all classes.

## Face analysis on Azure
- Computer Vision, which offers face detection and some basic face analysis, such as returning the bounding box coordinates around an image.
- Video Indexer, which you can use to detect and identify faces in a video.
- Face, which offers pre-built algorithms that can detect, recognize, and analyze faces.
  - Face can return the rectangle coordinates for any human faces that are found in an image, as well as a series of attributes related to those faces.

## Computer Vision service to read text
- The Read API
  - The Read API uses the latest recognition models and is optimized for images that have a significant amount of text or has considerable visual noise.
  - The Read API takes an image and extracts the words, organizing the results by page and line.

## Receipt analysis on Azure
**Form Recognizer** in Azure provides intelligent form processing capabilities that you can use to automate the processing of data in documents such as forms, invoices, and receipts
- A pre-built receipt model
  - Currently the pre-built receipt model is designed to recognize common receipts, **in English**, that are common to the USA.
  - The maximum file size for the pre-built receipt model is 50 MB
- Custom models
- There is a free tier subscription plan for the receipt model along with paid subscriptions. 
  - For the free tier, only the first two pages will be processed when passing in PDF or TIFF formatted documents.
- Both the **Form Recognizer** resource and **Cognitive Services** resource provide access to the Form Recognizer service


## Q&A
- Your organization has production lines for packaging fruit. You want to identify misshapen fruit and remove it before it is packed. Which service for computer vision should you use? (Custom Vision)
  - Azure Custom Vision service enables users to _create their own image classification models_ by training a model using their own images. The organization would be required to supply images of properly shaped fruit and images of misshapen fruit to train the model.
  - Azure Computer Vision service can analyze images; however, the analysis returned is based on models that the _service already has defined_. These models do not include analysis of fruit; therefore, Azure Computer Vision would not be able to detect misshapen fruit.

- Which of the following are use cases for the Language Understanding service (LUIS)?
  - Chatbot
  - Using a voice assistant to control IoT devices

- Which capability of the Translator Text service can convert text from its source script to an alternative script?
  - Transliteration

- Which of the following is a type of machine learning that could be used to recommend videos to a user of a streaming platform based on their viewing history?
  - Clustering

- Which of the following can take historical workload data and suggest whether a future failure will occur?
  - Category prediction

- **Spatial analysis** is the computer vision service that uses algorithms to track movement in a video feed and identify one or more humans.

- You work for a large streaming service that is looking to personalize movie recommendations based on a userâ€™s search history. Which NLP workload should you recommend?
  - Entity recognition
    - Entity recognition extracts nouns that are within a body of text. One of the major use cases for entity recognition are recommender services, such as recommending content for streaming services. Entity recognition is the NLP workload that should be recommended.

## Azure Policy
- Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources.
- Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as initiatives.
- Azure Policies are inherited.
- Azure Policy comes with built-in policy and initiative definitions for Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring.

## Resource locks
- A resource lock prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed.
- To modify a locked resource, you must first remove the lock.
- Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions. Even if you're an owner of the resource, you must still remove the lock before you can perform the blocked activity.

## Operational expense (OpEx) instead of capital expense (CapEx) 
Factors impact OpEx
- Resource type
- Consumption
- Maintenance
- Geography
- Subscription type
- Azure Marketplace

Consumption
- Pay-as-you-go has been a consistent theme throughout. 
- Azure offers the ability to commit to using a set amount of cloud resources in advance and receiving discounts on those “reserved” resources. 

Geography
- With this global deployment comes global pricing differences.
- The cost of power, labor, taxes, and fees vary depending on the location.

Network Traffic
- Some inbound data transfers (data going into Azure datacenters) are free.
- For outbound data transfers (data leaving Azure datacenters), data transfer pricing is based on zones.

# Learning objectives
- Learn the key factors that are driving changes in data generation, roles, and technologies.
- Compare the differences between on-premises data technologies and cloud data technologies.
- Outline how the role of the data professional is changing in organizations.
- Identify use cases that involve these changes.

## Data abundance
- Data can be structured, unstructured, or aggregated. For structured databases, data architects define the structure (schema) as they create the data storage in platform technologies such as Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics. For unstructured (NoSQL) databases, each data element can have its own schema at query time. Data can be stored as a file in Azure Blob storage or as NoSQL data in Azure Cosmos DB or Azure HDInsight.
